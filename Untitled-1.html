          <h3>Heart Anatomy Application</h3>
          <h4>Jul 2024 - Present</h4>
          <p>Vietnamese High school students lack access to study anatomy through technology so I developed my heart anatomy app so that students can access it. Explore the intricacies of the human heart with this interactive educational app built using Kivy, a Python framework for cross-platform applications. Whether you‚Äôre a student, a healthcare professional, or simply curious about cardiac anatomy, this app provides an engaging learning experience.</p>
          <h4>Features:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Visual Exploration: Navigate through detailed images of the heart, including chambers, valves, septums, and vessels.</li>
            <li>Learn and Discover: Dive into specific topics, from understanding heart valves to exploring the walls that separate different chambers.</li>
            <li>User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive buttons and seamless navigation make learning a breeze.</li>
            <li>High-Quality Graphics: Zoom in on specific areas for a closer look at heart structures.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>How It Works:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Launch the App: Start by clicking the ‚ÄúStart Learning‚Äù button.</li>
            <li>Explore the Heart: View the heart image and click on different components to learn more.</li>
            <li>In-Depth Content: Access comprehensive information about heart anatomy in the ‚ÄúLearn‚Äù section.</li>
            <li>Navigate Back: Use dedicated buttons to move between screens and topics.</li>

            <h3>Simple Insulin Dosage Calculator</h3>
            <h4>May 2024 - Jun 2024</h4>
            <p>Seeing that Vietnamese doctors are having trouble calculating the insulin dosage, I developed a simple pancreas simulator. The ‚ÄúArtificial Pancreas Simulator‚Äù is a Python application built using the Kivy framework.</p>
            <h4>Features:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>It simulates an artificial pancreas by allowing users to input their glucose levels (in mg/dL) and calculate the corresponding insulin dosage (in units).</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>How it Works:</h4>
            <p>The app features a slider for adjusting glucose levels and dynamically updates the insulin dosage label based on the input. It‚Äôs a useful tool for understanding insulin requirements in diabetes management.</p>

            <h3>Text to Voice</h3>
            <h4>Jun 2024 - Jun 2024</h4>
            <p>Associated with T-IT Telecommunications and Information Technology Ltd</p>
            <p>While at T-IT, I created my own simple yet powerful Vietnamese text-to-speech application using Python and Tkinter. This app allows you to input Vietnamese text, convert it to speech, and even translate it to English‚Äîall with just a few clicks!</p>
            <h4>Features:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Text Input: Type your Vietnamese text in the provided input box.</li>
              <li>Convert to Speech (Vietnamese): Click the ‚ÄúTi·∫øng Vi·ªát‚Äù button to generate an audio file of your input in Vietnamese.</li>
              <li>Translate and Speak (English): The ‚ÄúTi·∫øng Anh‚Äù button translates your Vietnamese text to English and produces an English audio file.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>How It Works:</h4>
            <p>I use the gTTS library to create audio files from text.</p>
            <p>The googletrans library handles translation between Vietnamese and English.</p>
            <p>Tkinter provides the graphical user interface (GUI) for our app.</p>
